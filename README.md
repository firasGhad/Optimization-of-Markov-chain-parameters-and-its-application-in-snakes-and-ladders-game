# Optimization-of-Markov-chain-parameters-and-its-application-in-snakes-and-ladders-game
a user-friendly software for basic calculations for Markov chains. This software can be used by users having no skills is specific software. Program showed high calculation performance in analytical calculations o relatively small Markov chains (up to 20 states). Accuracy of estimation in Monte Carlo simulations was good only in cases of relatively high transition probabilities depending on number of states, number of runs and amount of connections (not shown). Our software also enables playing and user friendly optimization of classical board game Snakes and Ladders. Results obtained for tested examples are consistent with ones described in literature and calculated using MATLAB. Local optimizations of Snakes and Ladders we enable significantly change average and variance of playing time.
